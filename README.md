Hey Guys!!
We are the Code of Duty 

The creators of Healtholite, a website which is a seamless flow between the Doctors and patients 

The main problem that we wanted to solve was creating - A platform for EHR, where doctors can check patient status, update any medical condition, provide prescriptions, find out disease probability with test results, 
while patients can schedule apointments with the doctor, check and share their medical report condition

Healtholite has everything you need for - 
Prediction of Disease 
Smooth interaction
Filling records 
Scheduling appointments
Checking data of patients  
Report Recognition

Our Approach - 
We used ML models by considering relevant data from vast databases and feeding it to provide a boolean for disease prediction with the highest level of 80% accuracy rate
We even tried to keep the interface friendly from the perspective of the patient and the doctor
For big data we even plan to store of all patients to be accessible by the medical institutions
